/*
 * HTML5 adds a new global attribute named [hidden], which is styled as display: none by default.
 * Borrowing an idea from PureCSS, we improve upon this default by making [hidden] { display: none !important; }
 * to help prevent its display from getting accidentally overridden. While [hidden] isnâ€™t natively
 * supported by IE10, the explicit declaration in our CSS gets around that problem.
